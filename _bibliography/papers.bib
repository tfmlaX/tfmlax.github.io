	abstract = {The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer has been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the first non-perturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 K and room temperature, which persist on picosecond time scales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.},

	abstract = {Nanodevices exploiting quantum effects are critically important elements of future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly limited by decoherence arising from local `environmental' interactions. Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but – on the other hand – the ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we study a fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream' kinetics of a `functional' quantum system. With access to complete system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.},

	abstract = {The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy-to-use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system–environment observables.},

	abstract = {Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches to perform numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment non-perturbative context, these methods require a clever choice of the topology of the wave-function Ans{\textbackslash}"atze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. We show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable to write the joint \{System + Environments\} state as a matrix product state, reduce considerably the bond dimension required for convergence. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses in order to tweak tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in several applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum collision models describe open quantum systems through repeated interactions with a coarse-grained environment. However, a complete certification of these models is lacking, as no complete error bounds on the simulation of system observables have been established. Here, we show that Markovian and non-Markovian collision models can be recovered analytically from chain mapping techniques starting from a general microscopic Hamiltonian. This derivation reveals a previously unidentified source of error—induced by an unfaithful sampling of the environment—in dynamics obtained with collision models that can become dominant for small but finite time-steps. With the complete characterization of this error, all collision models errors are now identified and quantified, which enables the promotion of collision models to the class of numerically exact methods. To confirm the predictions of our equivalence results, we implemented a non-Markovian collision model of the Spin Boson Model, and identified, as predicted, a regime in which the collision model is fundamentally inaccurate.},

	abstract = {This book proposes innovative and timely modeling, as well as simulation strategies based on tensor networks, to tackle the difficult problem of describing the dynamics of open quantum systems at the molecular or nanometer scale beyond a Markovian treatment. Among the many insights it delivers, the work includes calculations of the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a bosonic environment that can be potentially structured and/or possess spatial correlations. The relevance of these strategies is exemplified with the analysis of complex bio-inspired nanodevices. Researchers in the field will find here a clear and reliable contribution to the understanding of open quantum systems in a still little-explored regime where the reservoirs are no longer considered as simple baths but as sub-systems treated on an equal footing with the reduced system of interest. Moreover, the author discusses how to handle the situation of a system coupled to multiple baths. This is a very important and generic scenario, crucial, for instance, when discussing non-equilibrium steady states.},
