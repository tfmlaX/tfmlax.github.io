I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Ulm working on quantum effects in biological systems, and especially on the understanding of Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) in organic molecules such as DNA.

I hold a PhD in physics awarded for my work on theoretical descriptions of dissipation at the nanoscale beyond the markovian approximation under the supervision of [Brendon W. Lovett](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bwl4/Research_Page/Welcome.html) at the University of St Andrews, and [Alex W. Chin](https://w3.insp.upmc.fr/recherche-2/equipes-de-recherche/photonique-et-coherence-de-spin/photonique-et-coherence-de-spin-theorie-des-systemes-quantiques-ouverts-et-des-materiaux-nano-fonctionnels/) at the Institut des Nanosciences de Paris (Sorbonne Université). My thesis [*Beyond Markovian Dissipation at the Nanoscale*](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04135149) was awarded a Springer Thesis Award and is published in the [Springer Theses](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031831423) series.

My research interests revolve around studying the - most of the time - out-of-equilibrium dynamics of Open Quantum Systems (OQS) strongly coupled to their environment(s). This problematic is relevant for novel quantum technologies, condensed matter or biological systems (e.g. photosynthesis in plants) where strong coupling seems to be central for explaining several phenomena. More generally I work on non-Markovian OQS, i.e. when the environment is not forgetful of the past state of the system, and Tensor Networks techniques.

Prior to that, I worked in <em>deep tech</em> innovation at the Parisian start-up incubator [Agoranov](https://www.agoranov.com/) as a Junior Entrepreneur in Residence.

I graduated in general theoretical physics from the [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/MasterSDM/), and in scientific innovation from [PSL Research University](https://psl.eu/)'s Institute of Technology
and Innovation (ENS de Paris, École des Mines and Observatoire de Paris). I also passed the agrégation de physique-chimie national competitive examination.
