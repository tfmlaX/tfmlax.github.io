## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Software Development
	
### MPSDynamics.jl
I am leading the development of the open-source Julia package <a href="https://github.com/shareloqs/MPSDynamics/">`MPSDynamics.jl`</a>. This package is an implementation of the numerically exact T-TEDOPA method for the study of non-Markovian open quantum systems.

This package is aimed at researchers working on open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and more generally many-body physics. `MPSDynamics.jl` is developed continuously, and future releases will be devoted to its further improvement.

As of October 2024, `MPSDynamics.jl` has been used in 11 scientific publications published in peer-reviewed journals, on Github it has been forked 8 times and starred 57 times.

In praise of the package:
> A useful package like `MPSDynamics.jl` will undoubtedly facilitate the numerically exact study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics in fields such as photophysics, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum information, to name a few.

### Chaincoeffs
<a href="https://github.com/tfmlaX/Chaincoeffs">Chaincoeffs</a> is a set of routines to generate finite temperature chain coefficients (on-site energy, hopping energy and coupling constant) of a chain-mapped bosonic environment for the T-TEDOPA method. It has now been integrated natively in `MPSDynamics.jl`.
