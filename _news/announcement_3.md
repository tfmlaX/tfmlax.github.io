Quantum collision models are central in quantum thermo, open systems and quantum simulations but they lack a comprehensive error certification. In our [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-025-02201-2),â€¬ we elevate collision models to numerically exact methods and enhance their reliability ðŸ’¥âš›
